Tricob's 64x64 Images: Message from Tricob - "My TC's plans have officially changed - I'm moving from the original SOD palette and 64x64 images to 128x128 images with a different palette, so all the 64x64 images I've already made for my mod aren't going to be used. I'm therefore releasing the 64x64 version of the walls and sprites to the general public for use in their own TCs. There's two new enemies, six new treasure items, several new wall images (Sorry about the gaudy mansion wall; the palette worked against me), and a few other new sprites." Available here.
