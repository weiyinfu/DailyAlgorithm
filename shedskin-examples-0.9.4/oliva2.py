This is a short version of a program for the simulations of the color
patterns on tropical sea shells, here # Oliva porphyria# .
An autocatalytic activator a(i) leads to a burst-like activation
that is regulated back by the action of an inhibitor b(i). The life
time of the inhibitor is regulated via a hormone c, that is
homogeneously distributed along the growing edge. Whenever the number
of activated cells cells become too small, active cells # ain activated
until backwards waves are triggered

This program requires Python and ShedSkin (http://shedskin.sourceforge.net).
